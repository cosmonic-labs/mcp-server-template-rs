//! Skills over MCP (`io.modelcontextprotocol/skills`).
//!
//! Every server built from this template ships at least one **skill**: a
//! natural-language playbook that tells a connected agent *when* and *how* to
//! use the server's tools. Tools are the hands; the skill is the manual.
//!
//! The extension rides on the existing MCP **resources** primitive rather than
//! a new protocol method — see [`crate::server`] for the `resources/list`,
//! `resources/templates/list` and `resources/read` handlers that expose what
//! this module holds. Discovery is progressive:
//!
//! 1. A client reads [`INDEX_URI`] (`skill://index.json`) once at session
//!    start and gets a lightweight catalog: skill names plus the trigger
//!    descriptions it matches user requests against.
//! 2. Only when a request matches does it read
//!    `skill://<name>/SKILL.md` — the full playbook.
//! 3. Relative Markdown links inside a `SKILL.md` resolve against the skill
//!    root, so `[Tools](references/TOOLS.md)` is
//!    `skill://<name>/references/TOOLS.md`, pulled in only if the model needs
//!    that depth.
//!
//! Skill files are embedded with [`include_str!`], so the component is
//! self-contained: no filesystem, no network, and the playbook version can
//! never drift from the tool implementation it documents.
//!
//! ## Adding a skill
//!
//! Put it under `skills/<dir>/SKILL.md` (plus any supporting files) and add an
//! entry to [`SKILLS`]. The catalog's description comes from the `SKILL.md`
//! YAML frontmatter, so there is exactly one place to edit it.
//!
//! Directory names are fixed at build time (`include_str!`), but the skill's
//! *name* — the authority in its URIs — is [`env!("CARGO_PKG_NAME")`] for this
//! server's own skill, so renaming the package renames the skill with it.
