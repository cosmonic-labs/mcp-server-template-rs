//! The default route: a discovery/health document on `GET /`.
//!
//! The MCP specification does not say what a server should return on its root
//! path, but returning `404`/`405` there is a poor default: a developer
//! pasting the URL into a browser, a load balancer probing the workload, and a
//! crawler indexing the deployment all get a dead end, and there is no way to
//! ask "what is this and what does it offer?" without completing a protocol
//! handshake.
//!
//! So `GET`/`HEAD` on `/` and `/health` return `200` with a small JSON
//! document: server identity, the MCP revision spoken, where the protocol
//! endpoints are, the tool names, and the skills served (see
//! [`crate::skills`]). Protocol traffic stays on its own verb and paths —
//! everything else, including every `POST`, falls through to the MCP
//! transport untouched.
//!
//! ## Why this route is not behind the Host guard
//!
//! The DNS-rebinding guard (`MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS`) protects the MCP endpoint.
//! This document is deliberately outside it so health checks work under
//! whatever `Host` a probe sends. That is safe because it carries only
//! information a successful `initialize` would return anyway, and the server
//! emits no CORS headers, so a browser page cannot read the response
//! cross-origin.
